At the intersection of AI and healthcare, our biomedical research projects focus on developing intelligent, multimodal, and explainable systems to tackle real-world clinical challenges. From predicting the progression of Alzheimerâ€™s disease to forecasting ICU patient outcomes, these works prioritize transparency, robustness, and practical deployment. Leveraging deep learning, time-series analysis, and XAI, we aim to support clinicians with trustworthy tools that improve diagnosis, prognosis, and critical care decision-making across diverse patient populations.
