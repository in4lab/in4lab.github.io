During your time here, we will undoubted be interviewing candidates who are interested in joining the lab. Usually that interview process will include a presentation by the candidate — a research seminar, a code review, or some combination of those.  Everyone is welcome and encouraged to attend those presentations. If you have any impressions of the candidate (positive or negative) based on the presentation or any informal interactions, please let Andrew know.

In addition, you may be asked to have a one-on-one meeting with candidates. Here are a few notes about interviewing:

* When interviewing, try to assess both their _current skill set_, and their _future potential for growth_. For example, a less-experienced candidate who has demonstrated an accelerated trajectory of learning (including success in other job or life experiences) may be a better hire in the medium- or long-term. 
* The goal of having you meet with candidates is twofold — to help determine if they have a good skill set and temperament for our lab, and to tell them about your project and your experience here.
* It is better to go more in depth on a narrower set of subjects, rather than to cover many topics shallowly. In cases where we want you to cover a specific subject, we’ll communicate that to you in advance, otherwise the topic is up to you.
* Asking about specific past experiences is more valuable than hypothetical situations. For example, “In your last position, tell me about the most challenging part of working in that team” is more useful than “Do you like working in teams?”
* As your impression of the candidate evolves, seek evidence of the opposing view. For example, if you currently have a very positive impression of their technical skills, ask questions that might expose gaps in their knowledge. If you currently have a negative impression, hunt for areas in which their skill set might be deeper.
* Use silence to your advantage!  If you’re having trouble getting the candidate to volunteer information or going into depth, try smiling and nodding but not speaking.  Sometimes candidates need that pause to formulate their next thought.
* It’s our expectation that if you are meeting one-on-one with a candidate, that you will also attend their seminar/presentation.  If you’re not able to, please let us know in advance. 
* Jot down notes immediately after your meeting and send them to whomever is organizing the interview.

Thank you for helping with this important role!
