We use slack as the primary form of communication. The vast majority of channels are public -- feel free to browse and/or lurk as your interests dictate, even for channels that aren't related to your primary project. A few additional notes:

   * All lab members should join `#SR-402`
   * Local San Diego members should join `#local` (though remote people are welcome too!)
   * Some icebreakers and team building in `#random`
