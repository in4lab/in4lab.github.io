# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-wrench" %}Security and Behavioral AI Projects

Our security-focused research explores behavioral biometrics, continuous authentication, and adversarial robustness to strengthen user privacy and trust in modern computing systems. By harnessing motion sensors, touch data, and deep learning, we create lightweight, real-time authentication frameworks that safeguard smartphones even under adversarial conditions. These efforts extend to dynamic ensemble learning and decision-level fusion, enabling adaptive and explainable AI models across high-risk domains like cybersecurity, finance, and mobile platforms.
