Lab members are **encouraged** to use their vacation time to recharge, to visit family, to travel, or to do whatever the heck you want. 

Scripps observes **13 paid holidays per year**, as described in the [TSRI holiday policy](https://scrippsresearch.sharepoint.com/sites/hr/SitePages/Holidays.aspx).

Full time employees also accrue Paid Personal Leave (PPL), Extended Sick Leave (ESL) and Sick Bank Leave (SBL) according to [TSRI leave policy](https://scrippsresearch.sharepoint.com/sites/hr/SitePages/PPL-ESL-SBL-Paid-Time-Off.aspx). Graduate students and postdocs in the Su Lab are entitled to **15 days of PPL per year**.

All vacation days should be marked on the Su Lab Google Calendar (contact Andrew or Ginger if you need access) and pre-approved by Andrew or Chunlei.
