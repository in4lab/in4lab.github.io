Scripps Research has an onboarding process led by HR that will orient you on institution-wide policies.  In addition, there are a number of lab-specific tasks that we outline here:

* **Order a computer**: We have people using Mac, Windows and Linux. For those getting laptops (typical), most commonly we get them from Apple or Lenovo. It should be suitable for use as your primary development machine for ~2-3 years, and we usually find $3k to be a reasonable budget for that (but let us know if you find otherwise).  If you need an external monitor or peripherals, also include that. It's usually easiest if you configure a system and send us the specs to be ordered by Scripps.
* **Join slack**: email Andrew or Chunlei
* **Get added to the [Su Lab github organization](https://github.com/orgs/SuLab/)**: ask Andrew
* **Create a profile page on sulab.org**: See instructions [here](https://github.com/SuLab/sulab.org/blob/main/README.md#lab-members-actions)
* **Get added to relevant group meeting series**: See more info [here](/handbook/groupmeetings).
* **Arrange on-site seating**: Talk to Pam
* **For BioThings team members**: see also the [BioThings onboarding guide](https://github.com/biothings/biothings-internal/wiki/New-to-the-BioThings-team)

Sadly, there sometimes comes a time when people leave the lab.  Again, Scripps HR will handle many of the official separation details. Here are a few lab-specific notes.

* **Return equipment**: Any equipment purchased by the lab should be returned to the lab (unless alternate arrangements have been made).
* **Adjust your user profile**: In your [member page](https://github.com/SuLab/sulab.org/tree/main/_members), change the `group` value to `alum`. But before you go, please add a line or two on what exciting things are next for you.
