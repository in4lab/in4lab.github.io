Individual Development Plans (IDPs) are a great way to facilitate open communication between faculty members and individual students with the student's professional goals as the focus.  They provide a framework to discuss career goals, current strangths and weaknesses, short- and long-term goals, and training opportunities. Students and faculty are **required** to complete an IDP prior to the Candidacy Examination.  In addition, Andrew strongly encourage students to update their IDP annually and to make an appointment to discuss it.  More information, including IDP forms, can be found on [this Grad Program page](https://scrippsresearch.sharepoint.com/sites/education/SitePages/Student-Resources-Individual-Development-Plan.aspx).

NOTE: IDPs are mandated for graduate students, and for similar reasons, they are highly encouraged for postdoctoral researchers. Andrew is also open to completing an IDP for any group member to discuss their goals, skils, and career progression.
