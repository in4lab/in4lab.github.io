When printing a poster for a conference, the two most popular options are a paper poster (potentially higher quality visual) and fabric poster (easier to transport). There are many options for both. Current (July 2024) suggestions I hear from other faculty members:

* [PhD Posters](https://phdposters.com/): fabric and paper
* [Spoonflower](https://www.spoonflower.com/): fabric

Please update the list above and/or share exceptionally good or bad experiences with Andrew.
