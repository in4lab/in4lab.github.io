As part of the Scripps Research Graduate Program, Ph.D. students are expected to participate in regularly scheduled committee meetings. These meetings include both written reports and oral presentations that serve to evaluate each student's progress throughout the program. Detailed information about the various types of committee meetings can be found on this [page](https://scrippsresearch.sharepoint.com/sites/education/SitePages/Committee-Meeting-Types.aspx). 

For reference, curated example reports from students in the Su and Wu labs are available in this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hiyH3JaLi2IplZPoyFuTl8eSZKkQ86yy?usp=sharing).
