I’m a big believer in the idea that we should approach scientific talks as a form of storytelling. What does it mean to tell a story? It simply means guiding the audience through a linear sequence of events — of questions, ideas, and then solutions. For what it means to tell a great story and how to do it, I’d highly recommend that people watch this video (and particularly the first three minutes).
