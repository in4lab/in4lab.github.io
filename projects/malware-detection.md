## Project Description

The dynamic evolution of malware, combined with increasingly sophisticated evasion techniques such as **packing, obfuscation, and polymorphism**, presents a significant challenge to conventional security mechanisms. As a result, **machine learning (ML)-based malware detection systems** are being adopted widely due to their ability to generalize and automate malware identification. However, these systems are also **susceptible to adversarial threats**, and current solutions struggle to robustly identify evasive or morphed malware.

To address this critical issue, **InfoLab at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)** has led a comprehensive research project spanning three key investigations, each targeting a unique vulnerability in ML-based malware detection pipelines—from data representation and feature manipulation to evasion through software packing.

## Core Research Contributions

### 1. Spectral Analysis of Control Flow Graphs for Malware Detection

We propose a novel approach for malware classification using **spectral representations of control flow graphs (CFGs)**. Leveraging **heat and wave kernels**, the research extracts **size- and permutation-invariant graph signatures** for malware detection.

- **Dataset:** Over 37,000 Windows executables  
- **Models evaluated:** Eight ML classifiers  
- **Performance:** Accuracy of up to **95.9%**

**Key Insight:** Spectral signatures provide a scalable and effective alternative to byte-level feature extraction, especially in adversarial scenarios involving structural manipulation.

### 2. MLxPack: Investigating the Effects of Packers on ML-Based Malware Detection

This study examines how **packing techniques**—used to disguise malicious intent—affect ML classifier accuracy. Using a large dataset of **107,000 packed and unpacked samples**, the research explores both **static and dynamic features**.

- **Finding:** Dynamic analysis significantly improves detection robustness  
- **Best performance:** Achieved with **hybrid (static + dynamic)** feature sets

**Key Insight:** Detection systems must account for packing effects by incorporating **diverse feature representations** and **multi-perspective analysis**.

### 3. Visualization-Based Malware Analysis Using Feature Fusion

Focusing on **Android malware**, this study introduces a **feature fusion technique** that combines handcrafted **texture descriptors** (GIST, LBP, GLCM) with **deep CNN features** from grayscale images of malware components (e.g., `classes.dex`, manifest files).

- **Dataset:** DREBIN  
- **Accuracy:** Achieved **93.24%** across multiple ML models

**Key Insight:** Visualization-based static analysis offers a powerful and resilient approach to detect obfuscated and packed Android malware.

## Project Objectives

- Develop **robust, interpretable, and adversarial-resilient** malware detection pipelines.
- Analyze the **impact of binary obfuscation and packing** on static and dynamic ML-based detection models.
- Investigate **multi-view and feature-fusion strategies** for improved adversarial robustness.
- Design efficient and scalable representations (e.g., **spectral graph embeddings**) that capture malware behavior invariant to structural changes.
- Provide **benchmark datasets**, **evaluation protocols**, and **reproducible experiments** for the research community.

## Research Impact

This project by **InfoLab at SKKU** presents a **multidimensional approach to adversarial malware analysis**, bridging the gap between ML robustness and real-world evasion tactics. Key contributions include:

- Designing detection models resilient to **advanced evasion techniques** like packing and morphing.
- Developing **interpretable and generalizable malware representations**.
- Guiding the development of **next-generation defense frameworks** for both desktop and mobile environments.

Together, these efforts lay a **strong foundation for secure, explainable, and adversarially resilient malware detection systems**.
