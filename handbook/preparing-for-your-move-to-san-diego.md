For those who will be relocating to San Diego, here are Some notes that may help in planning your move:

* If you’re unfamiliar with San Diego, the weather is usually very nice. If weather is a concern for determining items you may want to bring, sell, or store away, you can view historical San Diego weather data [here](https://www.weather.gov/wrh/Climate?wfo=sgx)

* subscribe to the [scripps classifieds mailing list ](https://scrippsresearch.sharepoint.com/sites/its/SitePages/Subscribe-to-Email-Lists.aspx)

* Be sure to research housing prior to your move to avoid issues later on. Don’t just look at the number of stars on yelp, but actually read the reviews analytically. For example, [these reviews](https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-jolla-crossroads-san-diego) show very different experiences with the maintenance staff (great) vs the leasing/administration staff (poor) for the rental complex.
