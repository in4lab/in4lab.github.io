Inform Pam Graham (our lab admin coordinator) if you will be traveling. In general, all expenses associated with lab-approved travel will be reimbursed, including transportation, lodging, and meals. However, there are sometimes specific and non-obvious policies that must be followed, which is why coordination with Pam is critical. (For example, booking with a US-based commercial air carrier is often required when traveling on an NIH grant.) More information is available on the [Scripps Travel Reimbursement page](https://scrippsresearch.sharepoint.com/sites/finance/SitePages/Travel-Policy.aspx) and the full [Travel Policy](https://scrippsresearch.navexone.com/content/dotNet/documents/?docid=217)

After travel, submit all original itemized paid receipts to Pam for reimbursement. If ground transportation is used (mileage for personal car), reimbursement cannot exceed comparable coach airfare, and an example of economy/coach airfare must be attached.

For **non-travel reimbursements**, keep all itemized receipts of items purchased for lab business. For meal receipts, include the names of all the people who attended in an email to Pam Graham. Alcoholic beverages are not reimbursable.
