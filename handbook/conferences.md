We believe that all lab members (not just trainees, but also full-time staff members) should have ongoing access to training and networking opportunities.  These opportunities often come in the form of scientific conferences, but can also come in the form of educational courses or technical conferences.  Lab members are encouraged to attend one such event every year, with all expenses to be covered by the lab.  In most cases, lab members are expected to present their work (either a poster or oral presentation) when the opportunity exists.  Talk with Andrew to brainstorm training opportunities that are well-suited to you and to get final approval.

The three most common bioinformatics conferences are [ISMB](https://www.iscb.org/high-quality-meetings#past-ismb), [RECOMB](https://recomb.org/), and [PSB](https://psb.stanford.edu/previous/). Other common conferences attended by lab members include [BOSC](https://www.open-bio.org/events/), [Biocuration](https://www.biocuration.org/community/conferences/international-biocuration-meetings/).  In addition, lab members should look for relevant meetings run by [CHSL](https://meetings.cshl.edu/meetingshome.aspx), [Gordon Conferences](https://www.grc.org/), and/or [Keystone Conferences](https://www.keystonesymposia.org/).
