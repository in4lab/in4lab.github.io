### Security
The Su Lab is located on the fourth floor of the Stein Research Building.
Visitors may enter the building via the Beckman entrance. There are controlled access points into the building from the north side (3rd floor of Stein, near the hospital) and from the ground floor of Stein on the west side of the building.
Key card access is required for entry into the lab. The south entrance is located adjacent to the IT offices, while the west entrance provides access to the library.
 
 
### Safety

* **Fire Emergency**: In the event of a fire, the fire doors will close, blocking off entrance from Stein to Beckman. The stairwell in the southwest corner of Stein will still be accessible and can be used to exit the building on the ground floor of Stein, or via the hospital side entrance on the 3rd floor of Stein.
Regardless of the exit route, members should go to the designated area and report to the lab’s safety officer (Andrea) for headcount. The designated area is the “Flame of Knowledge” sculpture located near the Beckman Breezeway. Security will notify people in that area when it is safe to return.
* **Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs)**: The closest AEDs for Stein Research are located near the west of main library entrance and on the first floor by the main entrance.
* **Earthquake**: California has a lot of fault lines so earthquakes are expected. More often than not, they are not powerful enough to do much damage.  In the event of a strong earthquake here is [Scripps Research’s guide](https://scrippsresearch.sharepoint.com/sites/ehs/SitePages/Earthquakes.aspx?web=1) on what to do before, during and after a quake.
