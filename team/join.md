Are you passionate about security, privacy, or machine learning from the perspective of computer science, systems, or applied mathematics? Are you a curious developer or researcher who loves solving real-world problems with data and code? Are you excited to work in a collaborative environment with both academic and industry partners?

If any of those answers is "yes", then we’d love to consider you for a position. Between new research projects and graduating lab members, InfoLab at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), led by Professor Tamer AbuHmed, is frequently recruiting for **research interns**, **graduate students (MS/PhD)**, **postdoctoral researchers**, and **research developers**. You're welcome to [contact us](/contact) directly to inquire about current or upcoming opportunities.

**Note:** Prospective graduate students should apply through SKKU’s official [Graduate School admissions](https://admission-global.skku.edu/eng/index.html). Be sure to mention your interest in InfoLab and Prof. AbuHmed's research in your application.

**Important:** We are open to applications from candidates with unconventional academic or professional backgrounds. However, if your message does not clearly explain *why* you're interested in InfoLab, it may be overlooked. Personalized, thoughtful inquiries are strongly encouraged.
